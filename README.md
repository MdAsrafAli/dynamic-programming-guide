# Dynamic Programming - From Zero to Hero ðŸš€

Welcome to the **Dynamic Programming - From Zero to Hero** repository! This is a comprehensive guide designed to take you from the basics of recursion to mastering complex Dynamic Programming (DP) problems through structured learning and practice. Whether you're preparing for coding interviews or aiming to deepen your algorithmic skills, this guide provides a clear roadmap, example solutions, and practice problems.

## Overview

The main guide, [dp-guide.md](dp-guide.md), covers:
- **Foundational Concepts**: Understanding recursion and its limitations.
- **Memoization and Tabulation**: Techniques to optimize recursive solutions.
- **1D, 2D, and 3D DP**: Progressing from simple to advanced DP problems.
- **Advanced Techniques**: State compression, digit DP, and tree DP.
- **Practice Problems**: Curated problems from beginner to advanced levels.
- **Tips, Tricks, and Patterns**: Strategies to identify and solve DP problems efficiently.

The guide includes C++ implementations for key problems, organized by section, along with explanations of time and space complexities.


## Getting Started

1. **Read the Guide**: Start with [dp-guide.md](dp-guide.md) to follow the structured learning path.
2. **Explore Solutions**: Check the `src/` directory for C++ implementations of problems discussed in the guide.
3. **Practice**: Solve the curated problems listed in the guide, available on platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), and [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/).
4. **Contribute**: Found an error or want to add a new solution? See the [Contributing](#contributing) section below.

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, ensure you're comfortable with:
- Basic recursion
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Arrays and matrices
- Basic mathematics (e.g., combinatorics)
